# 1.0.0 released
Chat on sockets (just share your room with room id generated after slash :)) for your wholesome team - all data is synchronised between all players, so everyone can see extensive data and wounds/armor info updated in real time :)

All basic Friday Night Firefight rules implemented for all firemods (source refer to: CP2020 rulebook) + including cyberlimbs rules

Currently all rules are strictly connected to this rulebook, so i am going to make it more flexible at some point to easily make mods for it :) 

Code is not good at the point of missing functionality division and class layering and tremendous amount of initial result modification, omw to fix it on next releases :)

Feel free to host it up on your side or via ngrok for local sessions
