# 1.11.0 released
Chat on sockets (just share your room with room id generated after slash :)) for your wholesome team - all data is synchronised between all players, so everyone can see extensive data and wounds/armor info updated in real time :)

All basic Friday Night Firefight rules implemented for all firemods (source refer to: CP2020 rulebook) + including cyberlimbs rules

Currently all rules are strictly connected to this rulebook, so i am going to make it more flexible at some point to easily make mods for it :) 

Code quality is not good, at some point i am going to refactor it properly and remove pile of reused code, but not soon as i am finished for now with all needed features ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯

Feel free to host it up on your side or via ngrok for local sessions

Patch notes for further releases can be found [here](https://github.com/vivalafit/friday-night-firefight-chat/blob/main/patchnotes.md).
